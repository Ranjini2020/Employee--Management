# Employee--Management
It's an Employee Tracker project where the business owner can view and manage the departments, roles and employees in a company to be more organized and plan their business. This project also architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Design

The following database schema containing three tables:

![Database Schema](Assets/schema.png)

* **department**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold department name

* **role**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **title** -  VARCHAR(30) to hold role title
  * **salary** -  DECIMAL to hold role salary
  * **department_id** -  INT to hold reference to department role belongs to

* **employee**:

  * **id** - INT PRIMARY KEY
  * **first_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee first name
  * **last_name** - VARCHAR(30) to hold employee last name
  * **role_id** - INT to hold reference to role employee has
  * **manager_id** - INT to hold reference to another employee that manager of the current employee. This field may be null if the employee has no manager
  
  
## Functionality

Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees
  
  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * Update employee roles
  
  * View employees by department

## Minimum Requirements

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.
